# Predicting Patient No-Show Appointments Using Machine Learning

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting patient no-show appointments based on patient data.  The analysis focuses on identifying key features contributing to appointment non-adherence and building a predictive model to flag high-risk patients. This allows healthcare providers to implement proactive interventions, improving appointment adherence and optimizing resource allocation.  The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key statistics and model performance metrics to the console.  This includes information such as the chosen model, its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization plots (e.g., showing feature importance or model performance) saved as PNG files in the `output` directory.  These visualizations help understand the model's behavior and the factors influencing appointment attendance.


**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the input data used for the analysis.
